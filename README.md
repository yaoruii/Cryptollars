# Cryptollars
Cryptollars project--- a video game

We are a five-people group, all of whom have a strong understanding of blockchain technology and have extraordinary creativity. Everyone has made a significant contribution to this project.

Our group Crytollars came from the idea that we are the pioneers of the crypto area. The name is a combination of crypto and dollars, and it shows our enthusiasm and ambition. We brainstormed as a team in our group, and we cherish everyone's effort to improve the application. Implementing the game was not an easy task; we spent many hours and days discussing and programming, hoping to solve the problem and make every function convincing.

We build a Game-Fi application known as Sword Craft Online (SCO) for this project. Sword Craft Online is an online role-playing video game in which many people participate simultaneously (MMORPG) that uses the concept of De-Fi to allow its users to interact and trade with each other without the need for a financial institution. This game allows multiple people to join, play, and make interactions. The basic idea of this game is to get as many tokens as possible by beating monsters, staking them in the bank, or making trades with others. Recently, games like Elden Ring have similar battling functions, and transactions have become extremely popular. Combining blockchain theories with our multi-functioned game will doubtlessly bring players a brand-new game experience.
